        <h1>Olivia's Reading Response</h1>
        <p>This reading provides an in-depth exploration of the spatial dimension of the Internet. First, It transfer the traditional notion of cyberspace into a virtual space and viewing it as a tangible entity with a physical infrastructure. The idea that the vastness of the Internet may be concentrated in a single point at the center of the Earth inspires me. I think there is a degree of need to question the centralized nature of the Internet, especially the dominance of the state in Internet governance and infrastructure. In recent years, the Internet is not as free as it once was, and government agencies are monitoring it. Some unfavorable comments may be monitored and thus deleted just as soon as they are sent out. I think the discussion on "Net Neutrality" mentioned in the article is crucial and we should create an open and fair internet for all users. Some methods of visualizing and understanding the Internet through spatial analysis are provided here, providing a fresh perspective on how we understand the Internet.</p>

            <h2>Question:</h2>
            <p>With the increasing influence of the State in Internet governance, how can we create an environment of free and equal expression under the current circumstances?</p>
